**WireboundTextBaker** serves as a sandbox, where all game features
are developed and tested before moving them to Wirebound.

WIP:
- runtime text rendering (smt like skyline-bottom-left);
- terrain, grass, water idea&concept developing (procedural & tessellation).
The main ideas for the second are borowed from:

- procedural generation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToCozpl1sYY&t=1818s
